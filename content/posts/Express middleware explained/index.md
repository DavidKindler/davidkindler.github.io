# New test page

## New test page

This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

This cheatsheet is specifically _Markdown Here's_ version of Github-flavored Markdown. This differs slightly in styling and syntax from what Github uses, so what you see below might vary a little from what you get in a _Markdown Here_ email, but it should be pretty close.

You can play around with Markdown on our [live demo page](http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).

(If you're not a Markdown Here user, check out the [Markdown Cheatsheet](./Markdown-Cheatsheet) that is not specific to MDH. But, really, you should also use Markdown Here, because it's awesome. http://markdown-here.com)

Here are some things to try out:

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
```

(Technical note: _Markdown Here_ uses GFM line breaks, so there's no need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)

## YouTube Videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

```js
<a
  href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8AkLfYOgIrE
'
  target='_blank'
>
  <img
    src='http://img.youtube.com/vi/8AkLfYOgIrE/0.jpg'
    alt='IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE'
    width='240'
    height='180'
    border='10'
  />
</a>
```

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:
