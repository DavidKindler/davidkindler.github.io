# Hello and thanks for reading this blog.

I am a web developer/designer working for NXP Semiconductors in
Austin, Texas. This is the second iteration of my blog. The first one
was done in Wordpress and was not well maintained. This one has been
designed using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org).

I hope to maintain this one more frequently. If you have suggestions or recommendations for blog posts please let me know.

## Contact

If you would like to contact me the best way is via [email here](mailto:davidkindler-gatsby@kindler.email).
